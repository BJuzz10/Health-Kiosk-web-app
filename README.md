# UPDATES ON LATEST COMMIT(commit title: authUpdate)
- removed details regarding aws
- log in can be tested on the terminal using python auth.py
- still encounters minor bugs but otherwise functional(account logged in is now visible in Firebase console)
- Left to do now is figure out how to use that same process on the entire web app
